      <description>Our first tryout took place in Prosetin. There were a lot of firsts: We got together for the first time of the season, first time outside, first time with new coaches. It was a productive weekend, working of motion offence and re-learning to not get lost in a lobster trap and avoid middle-school passes.&#xA;The start of our journey to EUCF 2024 was great, the athmosphere is electrifying and we&amp;rsquo;re ready to bring the best of Czech ultimate onto the best European teams!</description>
