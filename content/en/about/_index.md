# Who are we?

East Block is a Czech Women's Ultimate Frisbee Team. The players come mostly from the east bohemia region of Czech Republic: Hradec Králové, Slatiňany and Žďár nad Sázavou. We are Czech national champions of 2023, both indoors and outdoors (and at juniors as well!). Since 2022, we are also competing at the EUCS (European Ultimate Club Season), fighting for top spots after finishing 6th last year.

## A little bit of history

{{< text-justify >}}

East Block women's team started its career as a strictly indoor team -- there were not enough of us to build a team to go play out on the grass. We waited a few seasons, establishing East Block as a easy-going, spirited and friendly team, getting some young faces to play with us in our characteristic blue jerseys with a white stripe. In winter 2016, things got moving, and in the spring of 2016, East Block held its first training camp and attended the Czech Nationals for the very first time.

Two years later, the first medals came -- two silvers from both indoor and outdoor championships. The ecstacy was real. We did it!

The year 2018 also marks the first year East Block went international, securing the 5th place at Vienna Spring Break.

In the coming years, we secured more silver medals as well as some lower placements. After covid pandemic, East Block joined forces with the girls from Chupacabras, creating a partnership that is flourishing even in the mixed division. Three years, 2020, 2021, and 2022, marked the frustrating years of finishing second to 3SB on three national championships in a row. 

But! In 2022, we finally decided to push ourselves to dream big and started playing at the highest European level. Opening the team to some external help from FUJ, we got to the EUCF and played tough and close games even with the top teams. Even though we finished 13th (out of 24 teams), we did put our name on the radar of everyone playing the EUCS.

Then, 2023 came. Finally, East Block managed to get not one, not two, but three gold medals: one at the indoor nationals, one at the outdoor nationals against the rivals from 3SB and last but not least, one at the junior nationals, proving to everyone that our young talent is to watch out for. Over 10 years of ups and downs, happy and sad tears, tournament after tournament, we slowly made it happend and the journey has been worth all the sweat and pain. We are even moving forward, chasing bigger highs, while carrying amazing memories with us at all times.

Predicted to become TOP 4 at EUCF, the pressure was building. Unfortunately, even after coming 2nd at Spring Invite, 1st at Vienna Spring Break and 1st at the regional qualitifaction, the pressure was too much and at the EUCF, we lost to Troubles in the quarterfinals. In the end, we secured an amazing 6th place.

Our journey does not end here. Both the national and european versions of the team are working hard to keep up with the best and fight for our spot at the top.
