# Hello and welcome!

We are **East Block** -- a Czech women's ultimate frisbee team, national champions and contenders at the highest level of European ultimate at EUCF.

Our spirit animal is the lynx, our anthem Lazy Town's [We Are Number One](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfYnvDL0Qcw) and our mindset is always set to be better than before. If you want to follow our journey to becoming Number One, you can watch us on Instagram.

## Wanna see us play?

We've been lucky to get a lot of attention on stream from ulti.tv in 2023. You can start with the Sprint Invite final against BDF Shout, the reigning EUCF champions.
