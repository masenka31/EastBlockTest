The team traces its origin to ... TODO: describe the origin.

The team later joined forces with Chupacabras, Žďár nad Sázavou, bringing both experienced and talented young players. The team kept improving, taking silver medals at the national level on a regular basis. It was time for a little change.

In 2022, we finally decided to push ourselves to dream big and started playing at the highest European level. Opening the team to some external help from FUJ, we got to the EUCF and played tough and close games even with the top teams.

The hype got real next year. With some new additions to the roster, the buzz has grown and we've been predicted to reach Top 4 at EUCF 2023. We fell short, losing the quarterfinals in universe point and later taking 6th place after Mooncup. Yet, we are strong, we are loud, we sing our lungs out and we are hungry for more. Getting ready for EUCF 2024, better than ever, more determined than ever, for the third time is the charm.
